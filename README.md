# Play Alternative Versions of Book Scenes

## Overview
This project creates an interactive game from a specific book episode, allowing players to experience the story from the main character's perspective and take new actions to see new alternative realities. 

## How It Works
The game engine:
- Extracts rooms and locations from the episode
- Generates the canonical sequence of events and character actions 
- Tracks key variables that influence the story
- Dynamically generates new events and updates world state based on player choices

## Current Scene
The game currently recreates the Ascomani invasion sequence from "Dark Age" (Book 5 of the Red Rising series). The game is playable by running `main.py`.
